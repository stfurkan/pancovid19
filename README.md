## Development and Deployment

### React (client)

* Change directory to client
```sh
cd client
```

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### Python 3 (python)

* Change directory to python
```sh
cd python
```
* Run createCovidJson.py file to create JSON files for the client

cp graph.json ../client/src/.
cp updated.json ../client/src/.
```

* If you want to get most up to date data into the JSON files, you should update your datasets from [JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series).
